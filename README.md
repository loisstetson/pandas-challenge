District Summary
Calculate the total number of unique schools.
Calculate the total number of students.
Calculate the total budget.
Calculate the average math score.
Calculate the average reading score.
Calculate the percentage of students who passed math.
Calculate the percentage of students who passed reading.
Calculate the percentage of students who passed both math and reading.
Create a DataFrame for the above calculations.
School Summary
Calculate the following metrics for each school:
School name
School type
Total students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average math score
Average reading score
Percentage of students who passed math
Percentage of students who passed reading
Percentage of students who passed both math and reading
Create a DataFrame for the above calculations.
Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order.
Save the top 5 schools in a DataFrame called "top_schools".
Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order.
Save the bottom 5 schools in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools".
Math Scores by Grade
Create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
Reading Scores by Grade
Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
Scores by School Spending
Create a DataFrame that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).
The DataFrame should include the following metrics:
Average math score
Average reading score
Percentage of students who passed math
Percentage of students who passed reading
Percentage of students who passed both math and reading
Scores by School Size
Create a DataFrame that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).
The DataFrame should include the following metrics:
Average math score
Average reading score
Percentage of students who passed math
Percentage of students who passed reading
Percentage of students who passed both math and reading
Scores by School Type
Create a DataFrame that breaks down school performance based on the "School Type".
The DataFrame should include the following metrics:
Average math score
Average reading score
Percentage of students who passed math
Percentage of students who passed reading
Percentage of students who passed both math and reading
Observable Trends

Charter schools outperform district schools in reading and math scores.
Smaller schools tend to have higher performing students than larger schools.
There is no clear correlation between school budget and student success.
